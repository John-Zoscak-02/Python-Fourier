# Python-Fourier

Over my winter break, I worked with two friends to create a program in Python for producing a Fourier series given an svg file https://github.com/DanielTolbert/Python-Fourier. This involved significant studying of the relevant mathematics, as well as investigation on how to implement scientific functions in python.
